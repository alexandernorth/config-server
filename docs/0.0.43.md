# Release 0.0.43

[ChangeLog](https://github.com/sdcio/config-server/releases)

## server side apply

Changed the reconcilers to server-side apply logic (more ribust way to handle k8s api)

## moved watch target to a dedicated reconciler

Now we have a dedicated reconciler that watches the status of the target every 5 min iso a go routine. Ensure more robust availability of the informer cache. This resulted in a 4th individual condition.

deployment artifact got this new option to enable the new reconciler

```yaml
    - name: ENABLE_TARGET
      value: "true"
```

## targetConnectionProfile, targetSyncProfile

Changed omitempty to pointer values, such that they don't point to defaults. e,g. encoding is not relevant for netconf and right now there is a default which does not make sense.

Added printercolumns in the targetConnectionProfile and targetSyncProfile crd, such that the configured parameters are visible

```shell
NAME                                                    PROTOCOL   PORT    ENCODING    INSECURE   SKIPVERIFY
targetconnectionprofile.inv.sdcio.dev/gnmi-skipverify   gnmi       57400   JSON_IETF   false      true
targetconnectionprofile.inv.sdcio.dev/netconf           netconf    830                 false      true
targetconnectionprofile.inv.sdcio.dev/noop              noop       0                   false      true

NAME                                                PROTOCOL   PORT    ENCODING    MODE     INTERVAL
targetsyncprofile.inv.sdcio.dev/gnmi-get            gnmi       57400   JSON_IETF   get      10s
targetsyncprofile.inv.sdcio.dev/netconf-getconfig   netconf    57400               sample   10s
```

## removed lastSeen from target

lastSeen parameters in the status field of the target got removed, since it led to continues updates for no reason. The discover will delete targets if they are no longer seen, which is a more robust mechanism.

## concurrency of the reconcilers

set to 16

## schema watch for targetdatastore reconciler

The targetdatastore reconciler also watches schemas and retriggers the reconciler on changes
