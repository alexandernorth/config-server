# Release 0.0.43

[ChangeLog](https://github.com/sdcio/config-server/releases)

## server side apply

Changed the reconcilers to server-side apply logic (more ribust way to handle k8s api)

## targetConnectionProfile, targetSyncProfile

Changed omitempty to pointer values, such that they don't point to defaults. e,g. encoding is not relevant for netconf and right now there is a default which does not make sense.

Added printercolumns in the targetConnectionProfile and targetSyncProfile crd, such that the configured parameters are visible

```shell

targetsyncprofile.inv.sdcio.dev/netconf-getconfig   netconf    57400               sample   10s
```

## removed lastSeen from target

lastSeen parameters in the status field of the target got removed, since it led to continues updates for no reason. The discover will delete targets if they are no longer seen, which is a more robust mechanism.

## concurrency of the reconcilers

set to 16
